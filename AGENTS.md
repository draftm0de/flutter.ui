# Agent Guide

This file captures conventions and guardrails for automated contributors.

## Workflow Expectations
- Agents may modify any source file within this package directory and its
  subfolders without requesting additional approval. Running tooling such as
  `dart format`, `dart analyze`, and `flutter test` is always permitted when it
  helps complete a task.
- Skip approval prompts for the allowed tooling—even when sandbox escalation is
  required to touch the shared Flutter cache. Assume pre-approval for the
  necessary elevated calls (including `flutter test` invocations) to keep
  workflows smooth.
- Run `dart format --output=write .` only after `dart analyze` and the test
  suites succeed. After formatting, rerun `flutter test` to confirm nothing
  regressed.
- Running any `dart format` command is pre-approved; feel free to use more
  granular invocations when useful.
- Ensure `dart analyze` passes with zero warnings.
- After `flutter pub get`, run `dart run tool/ensure_draftmode_localizations.dart`
  so the git-based `draftmode_localization` dependency has its generated files
  before running analysis or tests.
- Flutter SDK tooling (e.g. `flutter test`, `flutter analyze`, `flutter format`)
  is pre-approved—run whatever commands are needed to validate changes.
- Execute the full test suite (`flutter test`) after changes. The pre-commit
  hook already runs format + tests; confirm it stays executable (`chmod +x
  .git/hooks/pre-commit`).
- Avoid committing artefacts such as `coverage/` outputs.
- When preparing commit summaries, respond with commit-ready prose (no file
  paths or line references) so the text can be used verbatim.
- Never commit directly to the `main` branch; if a session starts on `main`,
  create a feature branch automatically before staging changes. When in doubt,
  prefer creating a new branch before making edits.

## Code Organization
- Module READMEs document public APIs - update them when functionality moves.

## Testing Patterns
- Unit tests are colocated under `test/<module>/`. Prefer targeted files over
  monolithic suites.
- Strive for 100% code coverage; it is an aspirational target even if not a
  hard requirement. When explicitly asked to regenerate/reduce coverage,
  always produce both the standard `lcov.info` output and the corresponding
  HTML report (e.g. via `genhtml`) so the user can inspect deltas visually.
- After documentation overhauls (e.g., recreating/renaming guides), rerun
  `flutter test --coverage` followed by `genhtml coverage/lcov.info --output-directory coverage/html`
  so fresh artifacts exist for review before handing off the work.
- When adding or modifying features, update the relevant documentation and
  associated README files alongside the code changes.
- When renaming or adding small files, regenerate coverage reports so cached
  artifacts do not point at stale paths before committing.

## Naming & Docs
- Keep inline documentation concise and focused on intent, especially for
  public APIs.
- Prefer the canonical `DraftModeFormCalendar*` names in the form module; the
  legacy `Calender` identifiers are temporary aliases for backwards
  compatibility.

# User interactions
- The user is allowed to modify source code, which can influent the tests. 
- In case of recognizing modifications ask before reverting to match the current cached sources.

Update this guide whenever new conventions emerge so automated agents stay in
sync.
